# Codetest site

## Using docker to run

Running `./build` followed by `./run` should be sufficient to setup and run the site using docker. I am however not overly experienced with docker so I may have done something incorrectly

## Dependencies

 * node v4.2.6
 * npm v3.5.2


Run `npm install` to get appropriate packages for site (express, ejs etc.)


## Notes

 * Both servers are required to be running for the site to work.
 * Using jquery and jsgrid to display the data properly
 * Uses textarea to display a lot of the data because it was the most readable and effective way of reading most of the data without messing up lots of styling and making it unreadable
